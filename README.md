## ✨ Features

This isn't just another to-do list. Here’s what makes the Intelligent Task Manager special:

*   **📝 Full CRUD Functionality**: Easily **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete tasks.
*   **🎨 Task Categorization**: Organize tasks by categories like `Career`, `Office Work`, or `Family`, each with its own distinct color for quick visual identification.
*   **⏱️ Duration Tracking**: Assign an estimated duration to each task to better plan your day.
*   **↔️ Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Intuitively re-prioritize your active tasks by simply dragging and dropping them into the desired order, powered by `framer-motion`.
*   **💡 Smart Suggestions**: Get a list of pre-defined task suggestions to quickly add common or important items to your list.
*   **💾 Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are automatically saved to your browser's `localStorage`, so you can pick up right where you left off, even after closing the tab.
*   **✅ Separate Active/Completed Lists**: Keep your workspace clean by moving completed tasks to a separate, collapsable section.
*   **🎬 Smooth Animations**: Enjoy a fluid user experience with subtle, meaningful animations for adding, completing, and reordering tasks, thanks to `framer-motion`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to run the project locally? Follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (version 14 or higher) and `npm` installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-todo.git
    cd intelligent-todo
    ```
    *(Don't forget to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username!)*

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    This will open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload as you make changes to the code.

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

*   `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
*   `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.
*   `npm run eject`: **(Use with caution!)** This is a one-way operation that removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files into your project for full control.

## 💡 Future Improvements

This project has a solid foundation, but there's always room to grow! Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:

*   **Backend Integration**: Connect to a real backend (like Firebase, Supabase, or a custom Node.js API) to sync tasks across devices.
*   **User Authentication**: Add user accounts to keep to-do lists private and secure.
*   **Advanced Filtering & Sorting**: Implement more complex sorting options (by due date, duration) and filtering by category.
*   **Themes**: Add light and dark mode themes.
